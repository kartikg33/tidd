**TIDD** is a software development approach that unifies the best of *TDD* (Test-Driven Development) and *IDD* (Interface-Driven Development).  

The core principle is simple:

> **Interfaces should be designed with testability as a primary concern, and tests should validate the contracts defined by those interfaces, not their internal implementations.**

To do this, every **unit of code** (a module, component, library, etc...) must consist of a **testable interface** that serves as a **contract between external code and your code**. Additionally, test suites and external code should be built against those **well-defined versioned contracts** instead of against **brittle code implementations**.
